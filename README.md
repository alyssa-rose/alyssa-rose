   1. Natural Language Processing 
   2. Space Exploration
   3. And basically anything else data science related!

 I graduated from the Tufts University School of Engineering with a B.S. in Data Science in 2021, where I graduated Magna Cum Laude with additional study in Arabic and 
 Mathematics. I'm currently pursuing a masters in data science at Johns Hopkins University in the Whiting School of Engineering
